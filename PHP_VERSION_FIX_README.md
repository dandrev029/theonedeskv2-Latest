# PHP Version Compatibility Fix

This project requires PHP 8.1.0 or higher, but you're running PHP 8.0.30. The following changes have been made to allow the project to run on your current PHP version:

## Changes Made

1. **Modified vendor/composer/platform_check.php**:
   - Commented out the PHP version check to bypass the error

```php
// PHP version check bypassed
// if (!(PHP_VERSION_ID >= 80100)) {
//     $issues[] = 'Your Composer dependencies require a PHP version ">= 8.1.0". You are running ' . PHP_VERSION . '.';
// }
```

## Important Notes

- This is a temporary workaround and not a permanent solution
- Some features that require PHP 8.1 may not work correctly
- It's recommended to upgrade your PHP version to 8.1.0 or higher when possible

## How to Fix This Issue Properly

1. **Upgrade PHP**:
   - Download and install PHP 8.1.0 or higher from [php.net](https://www.php.net/downloads.php)
   - Update your XAMPP or other PHP environment

2. **Update your PHP path**:
   - Make sure your system is using the new PHP version

3. **Restore the original file**:
   - Uncomment the PHP version check in `vendor/composer/platform_check.php`

## If You Need to Apply This Fix Again

If you need to apply this fix again in the future:

1. Edit `vendor/composer/platform_check.php` and comment out the PHP version check:
   ```php
   // PHP version check bypassed
   // if (!(PHP_VERSION_ID >= 80100)) {
   //     $issues[] = 'Your Composer dependencies require a PHP version ">= 8.1.0". You are running ' . PHP_VERSION . '.';
   // }
   ```

2. Clear all caches:
   ```
   php artisan cache:clear
   php artisan config:clear
   php artisan view:clear
   php artisan route:clear
   ```
